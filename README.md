## Some important key points in industry

  * ###### Programming is the key element of everything and you must know, atleast understand some programs first.
  * ###### CyberSecurity is not difficult at all, just a misconception.
  * ###### Computer Networking is soul of IT.
  * ######  *Curiosity* makes individual successful. 
  * ###### Skill matters not degrees.

## ***OffSec says you must try harder!!! - Abosolutely NOT, "YOU MUST TRY SMARTER"***


###### well, you should know these things mentioned below - 
1. Linux, windows command line(cmd - powershell) and file system - **Youtube is full of both :)**
2. Programming - Start with python then, you'll get the idea in future -  **FreeCodeCamp(Youtube)**
3. Cryptography basics - I will recommend you to do this -  **Same answer youtube**.
4. Technical skills - example memory, cpu, bios, dealing with harware components aswell as basic technical operations - ***Internet is your friend:)***
5. Computer Networking - *Something you must know* - **Again same answer, it's Youtube**.
6. Research or Googling - *Very Important in CyberSecurity*.

# *Our suggestions on Programming Languages*

# *ICS/Scada Operations*

![images](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71017420/188329134-a576d3d5-c55a-4d18-a392-53393576b0fa.jpg)

## Basics of ICS Pentesting (Paid/Free) - 

### Paid 

* [Fundamentals of ICS/SCADA CyberSecurity](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-ot-cybersecurity/) - ***Definately recommend it. if you want to understand faster and everything is covered there.!!!***

### Free 

* **What is ICS, Scada, HMI mainly.**
* **understand concept of MTU, RTU.**
* **Difference between  IT and OT Security and what's the main difference in both compared to other.***
* **OT is vulnerable in nature but what makes it vulnerable and why we can't resolve it by encryption.** 
*  **Understand ICS protocols for example  Modbus, S7, Profinet, Profibus  and various other.**

#### ***IMPORTANT - We can infiltrate in ICS as per configured environment and all depends on the victim's environment. you just have to explore many amazing things by yourself :)  (just research)***

# *Red Team Operations/Adversary Emulation*

![cybersecurity-RED-TEAM-CYBER-partner-page](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71017420/188329245-2b776c57-a1ed-41e4-a22a-b0667eb74b92.png)

## Basics for Red Team Ops 

* **Be familiar with Network Pentesting ( till  privilege escalation, post-exploitation and clearing tracks. This gonna help you in Red Team Methodology, so you may able to adopt things more deeper )** .

* **Requires practice and deep understanding cause Red Team Operations are totally Real-World and there's tons of things to explore !!!** .
*  **Always be willing to research and learn new things daily** .
* **If you're good with obfuscation before, It might help you in long run** . [OPTIONAL - You can learn or figure-out it after getting into Red-Team Operations too :)]
* **Mindset - Nothing is Secure** .
